UIDevice-UserInterfaceExtendedIdiom
===================================

An Objective-C category that uses method swizziling to extend the default [UIDevice userInterfaceIdiom] to a 
custom implementation that additionally checks for the iPhone 5 user interface idiom.

This category is released under public domain. Go for broke. :)

Mad props to Matthew Robinson for his kick-ass UITableViewStyleGangnam project that demonstrated how to perform swizziling within categories.
